# Crypted File Decrypter
A WPF application that decrypts files that have been encrypted by the Nemucod ransomware virus.

If many of your personal files have been changed to end in ".crypted" and you are unable to open them, then this tool may be able to help recover your files. It is very important to note that the tool will not remove the virus from your computer, which will likely involve reinstalling Windows. If you are unsure how or are uncomfortable doing this yourself, then you are advised to seek help from a professional IT team. Large stores that sell computers will generally have people that can help you through this process.
