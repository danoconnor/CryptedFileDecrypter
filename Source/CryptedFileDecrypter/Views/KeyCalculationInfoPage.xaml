        <TextBlock Margin="{StaticResource BulletPointListMargin}">• <Bold>Camera photos</Bold> - Check your cell phone or digital camera for copies of photos that were saved on your PC. The phone or camera version may be a valid backup file to the encrypted photo stored on your PC."</TextBlock>
        <TextBlock Margin="{StaticResource BulletPointListMargin}">• <Bold>Internet downloads</Bold> - Take a look at the encrypted files in the downloads folder on your PC. Try to re-download the same file from the internet again. The new downloaded version may be a valid backup file to the encrypted version stored on your PC."</TextBlock>
        <TextBlock Margin="20,5,0,20">• <Bold>External or cloud storage</Bold> - Try to locate backups on any flash drive, external hard drive, or cloud storage service that you use.</TextBlock>
